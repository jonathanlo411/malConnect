<p style="text-align: center;">Watch/Read easily directly from MyAnimeList</p>
</div>

## Overview
malConnect is a lightweight chrome extension that provides direct links to watch/read the material on 3rd party sites directly from the MyAnimeList entry page. The extension will query various sites to return links to the source. Since a request is made each time a user views the MyAnimeList entry page, links are always up to date. Each link is set to the next episode from each page.
