## Overview
malConnect is a chrome extension that provides direct links to watch/read the material on 3rd party sites directly from the MyAnimeList entry page. The extension will query various sites to return links to the source. Since a request is made each time a user views the MyAnimeList entry page, links are always up to date.

## Installation
You can add malConnect to your chrome browser [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/malconnect/chjndlglgibbpffohnodhcfohpfegogg).
